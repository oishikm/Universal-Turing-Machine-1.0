Project Name:		Universal Turing Machine
					Version:	1.0
					
Details:

This project is to simulate a Universal Turing Machine as dreamt and designed by Sir Allan Turing.
A Universal Turing Machine takes input and produces output on an Input/Output Tape. This tape is ideally infinite.
The machine takes two inputs:

1. Code 'M' representing any Turing Machine [M] (i.e. State Transition Functions).

2. The input 'E' to drive the Machine [M].

After coming to a HALT, the machine will display the internal state as well as the I/O Tape.
